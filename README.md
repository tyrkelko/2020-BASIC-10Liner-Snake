# 2020-BASIC-10Liner-Snake
My entry for the 2020 BASIC 10 Liner Competition I have a special place for my first computer, the ATARI 800XL. Still have one, and love working on it or on emulators of it.  In this project I've accepted the challenge of writing a 10 line basic game program removing some rust off my ATARI BASIC skills.
